                    <p>on Facebook and Instagram ,&nbsp;<br>you would make a post and add some relevant tags ,&nbsp;<br>then you would hope that people who follow these tags ,&nbsp;<br>see your content and respond with a public comment or a private message<br>this is so because these are primarily platforms for social interaction and not for knowledge building&nbsp;<br><br>The problem is that Facebook is not designed to help you build on top of the work of others ,<br>here you can directly link the note and start building upon the work ,&nbsp;<br>the platform has collaboration built in ,&nbsp;<br>and allows for non linear , non structured&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;<br><br>while on Facebook and Instagram you can search , and there is a lot knowledge there ,&nbsp;<br>But Facebook was not built with the primary focus of organizing knowledge in to a usable network&nbsp;<br>which you can explore for solutions ,&nbsp;<br>On Facebook instead what you find is algorithms ,&nbsp;<br>that are optimizing for engagement , making you spend the most possible time on the platform .<br>This network is built only on links defined by the authors ,&nbsp;<br>we do have a basic search engine , that merely matches notes with the highest word similarity score .<br><br>But that is a simple text search algorithm , not a machine learning algorithm that is tracking your activity and predicting what content will give you the highest amount of pleasure ,so as ot make you addicted to the platform .<br><br>Here , there is no tracking , predicting , and marketing manipulation .<br>You see what authors like you wanted to show you .<br></p>

                            <p>when we consider Quora and Medium and Reddit ,&nbsp;<br>these sites are about knowledge sharing ,<br>and in many ways this Network is a evolution of these ideas ,<br><br>On Quora you have the question answer paradigm ,&nbsp;<br>this has been simplified here in the form of just notes ,&nbsp;<br>this changes the focus from seeking answers on questions ,&nbsp;<br>to seeking knowledge via discussion and collaboration&nbsp;<br><br>On medium , there is the same concept of authors providing knowledge to readers ,&nbsp;<br>but there is no sense of converstaion , of two-way dialogue between authors and readers ,<br></p>

                    <p>here , through the linking feature , authors not only give out their views ,&nbsp;<br>but also create a context of the discussion , and have a collaborative discussion about the ideas shared<br><br>On Reddit , there are communities on different topics ,&nbsp;<br>and Reddit is indeed better for discovering structured knowledge ,<br>Things we know about and understand , things we can put into boxes and categories called subreddits ,<br><br>This network is built un-structured , un-hierarchical knowledge ,&nbsp;<br>A quote about the shortness of life , a tip about eliminating distractions ,&nbsp;<br>A perspective on a world changing invention ,&nbsp;<br>all these can be shared on Reddit ,and they already are ,<br><br>but they are all in their individual Silos , their individual subreddits ,&nbsp;<br>there is categorization , excessive categorization ,&nbsp;<br>and then category-less knowledge, which is arguably more important ,&nbsp;<br>is also forced into only category , where&nbsp;only perspective is used for analyzing it ,<br><br>if humans new everything there is to know , reddit would be the way to go , to go about organizing this knowledge<br>but since we keep discovering new things , things we don't know how to categorize ,&nbsp;<br>A link , a connection based network is better to model such knowledge ,<br>Reddit has no ways to build connections across multiple topics , and create a multi-dimensional addition of knowledge .<br><br></p>
